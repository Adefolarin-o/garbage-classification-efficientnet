# garbage-classification-efficientnet
This project implements a deep learning pipeline for classifying garbage images into different categories using transfer learning with EfficientNetV2B0. It includes data augmentation, a two-phase training strategy (freezing and fine-tuning), and an interactive test explorer for visualizing predictions.
